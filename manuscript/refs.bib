abstract = {Motivation: High mass accuracy is an important goal in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry experiments. Some manufacturers employ a mass calibration system that regularly switches between the analyte and a standard reference compound, and leads to gaps in the analyte data. We present a method for correction of such gaps in global molecular profiling applications such as metabolomics. We demonstrate that it improves peak detection and quantification, successfully recovering the expected number of peaks and intensity distribution in an example metabolomics dataset.},

abstract = {Most biological diversity on Earth is contained within microbial communities. In the ocean, these communities dominate processes related to carbon fixation and nutrient recycling. Yet, specific factors that determine community composition and metabolic activity are difficult to resolve in complex microbial populations, complicating predictions of microbial processes in a changing ocean. Microbial metabolism generates small organic molecules that reflect both the biochemical and physiological diversity as well as the taxonomic specificity of these biological processes. These small molecules serve as the conduit for taxon-specific signaling and exchange. Here, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics to taxonomically categorize 111 metabolites that include small molecules in central and secondary metabolism across 42 taxa representing numerically dominant and metabolically important lineages of microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs. Patterns in metabolite presence-absence broadly reflected taxonomic lineages. A subset of metabolites that includes osmolytes, sulfur-containing metabolites, sugars, and amino acid derivatives provided chemotaxonomic information among phytoplankton taxa. A variety of phytohormones and signaling molecules were predominantly found in the heterotrophic bacteria and archaea, expanding knowledge of metabolites implicated in modulating interactions between microbes. This chemotaxonomic inventory of marine microbial metabolites is a key step in deciphering metabolic networks that influence ocean biogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {Non-targeted mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important method over recent years in the fields of metabolomics and environmental research. While more and more algorithms and workflows become available to process a large number of non-targeted data sets, there still exist few manually evaluated universal test data sets for refining and evaluating these methods. The first step of non-targeted screening, peak detection and refinement of it is arguably the most important step for non-targeted screening. However, the absence of a model data set makes it harder for researchers to evaluate peak detection methods. In this Data Descriptor, we provide a manually checked data set consisting of 255,000 EICs (5000 peaks randomly sampled from across 51 samples) for the evaluation on peak detection and gap-filling algorithms. The data set was created from a previous real-world study, of which a subset was used to extract and manually classify ion chromatograms by three mass spectrometry experts. The data set consists of the converted mass spectrometry files, intermediate processing files and the central file containing a table with all important information for the classified peaks.},

Here we present a liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) method for reliable measurement of 141 metabolites, including components of central carbon, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. The selected LC approach, hydrophilic interaction chromatography with an amino column, effectively separates highly water soluble metabolites that fail to retain using standard reversed-phase chromatography. MS/MS detection is achieved by scanning through numerous selected reaction monitoring events on a triple quadrupole instrument. When applied to extracts of Escherichia coli grown in [12C]- versus [13C]glucose, the method reveals appropriate 12C- and 13C-peaks for 79 different metabolites. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Pirttila2022,
abstract = {LC–MS-based untargeted metabolomics is heavily dependent on algorithms for automated peak detection and data preprocessing due to the complexity and size of the raw data generated. These algorithms are generally designed to be as inclusive as possible in order to minimize the number of missed peaks. This is known to result in an abundance of false positive peaks that further complicate downstream data processing and analysis. As a consequence, considerable effort is spent identifying features of interest that might represent peak detection artifacts. Here, we present the CPC algorithm, which allows automated characterization of detected peaks with subsequent filtering of low quality peaks using quality criteria familiar to analytical chemists. We provide a thorough description of the methods in addition to applying the algorithms to authentic metabolomics data. In the example presented, the algorithm removed about 35% of the peaks detected by XCMS, a majority of which exhibited a low signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm is made available as an R-package and can be fully integrated into a standard XCMS workflow.},
